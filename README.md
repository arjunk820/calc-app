# calc-app

## Introduction
I created this Python calculator app mostly out of boredom as well as ensuring I kept my Python skills fresh. The program accepts operations in string format and only expects numbers which can be easily converted into integers and arithmetic operators via string parsing.

## Setup
git clone https://github.com/arjunk820/calc-app.git

Use the above command to clone the repository.

## Usage

Run the command `python calc.py` in bash. In terminal, enter operations as needed to be solved. Enter 'q' to quit the program.

## Application

The script `calc.py` instantiates an object of `Calculator.py`, a file which holds a Calculator class I wrote for this application. Most of the "calculating" is in private functions performed by the parseEquation() function.
